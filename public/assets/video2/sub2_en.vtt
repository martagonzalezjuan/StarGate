00:00.000 --> 00:09.880
The images in this video are all real, taken by NASA's Mars rover directly from the surface

00:09.880 --> 00:22.080
of the planet.

00:22.080 --> 00:29.960
This is Mars in 4K, so sit back, relax, and enjoy this journey across the surface of another

00:29.960 --> 00:33.760
world.

00:33.760 --> 00:39.040
The team at NASA has given Mars informal place names, which you will see on the screen in

00:39.040 --> 00:41.640
the bottom left corner.

00:41.640 --> 00:45.880
Four different rover missions have contributed to this incredible footage.

00:45.880 --> 00:50.600
Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance.

00:50.600 --> 00:57.400
The latter two still roam the surface today, yet Spirit and Opportunity are gone, lost

00:57.400 --> 01:10.640
to the sands of time.

01:10.640 --> 01:17.920
We meet in an hour of change and challenge, in a decade of hope and fear, in an age of

01:17.920 --> 01:20.760
both knowledge and ignorance.

01:20.760 --> 01:29.840
The greater our knowledge increases, the greater our ignorance unfolds.

01:29.840 --> 01:35.720
The Curiosity rover continues to rise the hillside of Mount Sharp, the mountain it has

01:35.720 --> 01:39.000
been climbing for over 10 years.

01:39.000 --> 01:52.240
This was once a vast lake.

01:52.240 --> 01:56.680
The most recent rover, Perseverance, has brought along a friend.

01:56.680 --> 01:59.440
It's a helicopter called Ingenuity.

01:59.440 --> 02:05.280
These two explorers are also situated in an ancient lake, on the other side of the planet.

02:29.440 --> 02:36.440
No man can fully grasp how far and how fast we have come.

02:59.440 --> 03:26.480
The rovers have proved beyond all reasonable doubt that Mars once had active water systems.

03:26.480 --> 03:30.000
The only remaining question is if Mars had life.

03:57.000 --> 04:04.000
It's surprising that some would have us stay where we are a little longer to rest, to wait.

04:04.000 --> 04:10.520
But this city of Houston, this state of Texas, this country of the United States was not

04:10.520 --> 04:15.520
built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them.

04:26.520 --> 04:38.240
The Ingenuity helicopter has been a fantastic scout for the rover, providing incredible

04:38.240 --> 04:39.240
images.

04:39.240 --> 04:42.840
Here, it flew over the wreckage left behind the mission's landing.

04:56.480 --> 05:25.840
Let both sides seek to invoke the one and only Mars rover, the Ingenuity.

05:26.840 --> 05:29.840
It's the wonders of science, instead of its terrors.

05:30.840 --> 05:33.840
Together, let us explore the stars.

05:34.200 --> 05:58.200
The Opportunity rover covered over 28 miles, or 45 kilometers, in under 15 years.

05:58.200 --> 06:03.200
It's deemed by many as NASA's most successful mission ever.

06:03.560 --> 06:09.560
It was only stopped by a global Martian dust storm, which left it without power and exposed

06:09.560 --> 06:12.560
internal components to freezing temperatures.

06:13.560 --> 06:19.560
The last data NASA received from the rover roughly translates to, my battery is low and

06:19.560 --> 06:21.560
it's getting dark.

06:21.920 --> 06:36.920
Since the beginning of time, all moments have led to this moment.

06:36.920 --> 06:43.920
The great scientists and philosophers of the past could only dream of this moment.

06:43.920 --> 06:48.920
Our lifetimes are just a blip on the cosmic scale.

06:49.280 --> 06:54.280
Yet here we are, gazing out onto the surface of another world.

06:57.280 --> 07:00.280
Appreciate this moment here and now.

07:19.280 --> 07:26.280
I do say that space can be explored and mastered without feeding the fires of war, without

07:26.280 --> 07:33.280
repeating the mistakes that man has made in extending his writ around this globe of ours.

07:33.280 --> 07:40.280
There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet.

07:40.280 --> 07:43.280
Its hazards are hostile to us all.

07:43.640 --> 07:46.640
Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind.

07:47.640 --> 07:52.640
And its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again.

08:04.640 --> 08:06.640
We choose to go to the moon.

08:06.640 --> 08:09.640
We choose to go to the moon.

08:13.640 --> 08:20.640
We choose to go to the moon and dedicate it to the other things, not because they are

08:20.640 --> 08:23.640
easy, but because they are hard.

08:43.280 --> 08:46.640
Thank you for watching!
