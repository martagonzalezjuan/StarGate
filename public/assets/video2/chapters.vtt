{"label": "Introduction to Mars", "image": "pictures/mars1.webp", "text": "The images you are about to see are not simulations or artistic interpretations—they are real photographs captured directly from the surface of Mars by NASA's rovers. These robotic explorers, designed to withstand the planet’s harsh conditions, have been roaming the Martian landscape for years, uncovering clues about its history, climate, and potential for past life.\nOne of the most iconic rovers contributing to this breathtaking footage is Perseverance, which landed in Jezero Crater in February 2021. Equipped with high-resolution cameras, a laser spectrometer, and even a microphone, Perseverance has been investigating ancient lakebeds, searching for signs of microbial life and collecting samples for a future return to Earth. Alongside it, the small but groundbreaking Ingenuity helicopter has performed the first powered flights on another planet, providing an aerial perspective of Mars like never before.\nBefore Perseverance, rovers like Curiosity (2012), Opportunity (2004-2018), and Spirit (2004-2010) paved the way for Martian exploration, sending back stunning panoramas, discovering evidence of past water activity, and enduring dust storms that would eventually claim their missions. Each of these robotic geologists has played a vital role in shaping our understanding of Mars, transforming it from a distant mystery into a world we can now explore in incredible 4K resolution.\nSo sit back, relax, and embark on this journey across the surface of another world—one that, in the not-so-distant future, may host the first human footprints beyond Earth."}

{"label": "Exploring Mars togethers", "image": "pictures/mars2.webp", "text": "NASA has given various regions on Mars informal place names, which you will see displayed on the bottom left corner of the screen. These names, often chosen by the teams of scientists working on the rovers, help bring a sense of familiarity to the alien landscape, as the rovers traverse Martian terrains that are utterly foreign to us. Some of these locations are named after famous scientists, places on Earth, or even after features that resemble Earthly landscapes.\nThe stunning footage you are seeing has been captured by four distinct rover missions: Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance. These rovers have collectively worked to explore the Martian surface over more than a decade. Spirit and Opportunity, which both landed in 2004, were pioneers in this effort. Spirit’s mission ended in 2010 after a technical failure, while Opportunity persisted until 2018, when it was lost after a massive dust storm. Despite their absence, their discoveries continue to shape our understanding of Mars, from evidence of ancient water to geological formations that suggest the planet once had a more Earth-like climate.\nMeanwhile, Curiosity, which landed in 2012, and Perseverance, which arrived in 2021, continue to provide invaluable data, investigating Mars' habitability and searching for signs of past life in locations like Gale Crater and Jezero Crater. Their missions also include gathering samples that could one day be returned to Earth.\nThe journey of these rovers has unfolded during a time of rapid change, filled with moments of triumph and setbacks. Their findings have revealed great advances in our knowledge of Mars, yet have also shown how much there is still to learn, highlighting the paradox of human exploration: the more we know, the more we realize there is still to discover.\nIn the words of John F. Kennedy, “We meet in an hour of change and challenge, in a decade of hope and fear, in an age of both knowledge and ignorance.” As we continue to explore Mars, we are reminded of the limits of our current understanding, yet also inspired by the boundless opportunities ahead."}

{"label": "Mount Sharp", "image": "pictures/mars3.webp", "text": "The Curiosity rover continues its journey up the slopes of Mount Sharp, a mountain that it has been ascending for over 10 years in its search for clues about Mars' past environment. Once home to a vast lake, this area now holds the secrets of Mars' ancient climate, with Curiosity providing important data to piece together the planet's history.\nThe more recent rover, Perseverance, has a companion on its mission: a small helicopter named Ingenuity. Together, they are exploring an ancient lake in the Jezero Crater—a location that may have once supported microbial life. Ingenuity has already made history as the first aircraft to fly on another planet, providing new perspectives for Mars exploration.\nThese two rovers and Ingenuity are positioned on opposite sides of the planet, yet their discoveries converge in the same goal: to unravel the mysteries of Mars' past and its potential for life. The adventure of Mars exploration continues to push the limits of human ingenuity.\nIn the words of John F. Kennedy, No man can fully grasp how far and how fast we have come. From the first robotic landings on Mars to the present day, humanity’s exploration of the Red Planet is a journey that seems to accelerate with every mission."}

{"label": "The Jezero crater", "image": "pictures/mars4.webp", "text": "The rovers have proven beyond all reasonable doubt that Mars once had active water systems—rivers, lakes, and perhaps even an ocean. Evidence in the form of ancient riverbeds, minerals that form in water, and the features of the Martian surface suggest that Mars was once far more hospitable than the cold, dry planet we see today. The crucial remaining question now is: Did Mars have life? This question is at the heart of current and future missions, including Perseverance’s search for signs of ancient microbial life.\nIt’s fascinating that, even in the face of such groundbreaking discoveries, some might suggest that humanity should hold off on making further advances, to rest or wait. But, as John F. Kennedy once said: This city of Houston, this state of Texas, this country of the United States was not built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them. The spirit of exploration that has led to Houston, NASA, and the great achievements of space exploration isn’t about pausing in the face of the unknown—it’s about boldly moving forward, no matter how daunting the task ahead may seem.\nMars represents a new frontier for humanity, and the curiosity that drives us to explore it is the same spirit that has propelled us into the future since the earliest days of space exploration."}

{"label": "Rover's death", "image": "pictures/mars6.webp", "text": "The Opportunity rover, one of the most successful missions in NASA's history, covered an astonishing 28 miles (45 kilometers) on the surface of Mars during its nearly 15-year mission. This remarkable achievement allowed Opportunity to explore a vast portion of the Martian landscape, capturing stunning images and discovering important scientific data about the planet’s geology and past water activity.\nMany consider Opportunity to be NASA's most successful rover mission, thanks to its longevity, resilience, and the wealth of information it provided. Unfortunately, the rover's mission came to a tragic end when a global dust storm enveloped Mars in 2018, blocking out sunlight and leaving Opportunity without power. The storm also exposed the rover’s internal components to freezing temperatures, ultimately causing it to fail.\nThe last data NASA received from Opportunity is poignant and heart-wrenching: My battery is low and it's getting dark. These were the rover's final words, marking the end of a journey that lasted far beyond expectations and provided humanity with invaluable insights into the Red Planet. The rover’s legacy continues to inspire scientists and explorers today."}

{"label": "Outro", "image": "pictures/mars7.webp", "text": "Since the beginning of time, every event has led to this very moment—our time to explore the unknown, a moment that great scientists and philosophers of the past could only dream about. Our lifetimes are but a brief moment on the cosmic scale, yet here we are, gazing out at the surface of another world, taking part in a journey unlike anything before. It’s important to appreciate this moment, as it reflects the culmination of centuries of human curiosity and discovery.\nAs John F. Kennedy once so eloquently said, I do say that space can be explored and mastered without feeding the fires of war, without repeating the mistakes that man has made in extending his writ around this globe of ours. Space represents a unique opportunity for peaceful cooperation, free from the strife, prejudice, and national conflicts that dominate Earth. Its challenges are the same for all of humanity, and its conquest deserves the best of mankind’s efforts.\nThe desire to explore space was famously captured by Kennedy when he said, “We choose to go to the moon, not because it is easy, but because it is hard.” It wasn’t about doing what was simple—it was about taking on a challenge that pushed the boundaries of what was possible. This spirit of adventure and unity still drives our exploration of the cosmos today."}
