Surrounding our blue planet, unimaginable wonders exist, wonders that until recently

00:18.680 --> 00:25.280
had never been gazed upon before. For more than 30 years, however, an incredible space

00:25.280 --> 00:30.840
telescope has been returning images of these beautiful wonders as it attempts to reveal

00:30.840 --> 00:40.840
the secrets of the universe. The Hubble Space Telescope was launched in 1990 and now orbits

00:40.840 --> 00:48.640
about 340 miles or 550 kilometers above the Earth, freeing it from our planet's atmosphere

00:48.640 --> 00:54.840
that can block our view of the cosmos. This enables Hubble to consistently outperform

00:54.840 --> 01:00.120
many of the most advanced ground-based telescopes, allowing it to capture sharp

01:00.120 --> 01:06.360
images of faraway objects like never before. In order to produce the colour images you're

01:06.360 --> 01:12.520
about to see, Hubble uses electronic sensors to probe the universe. Those sensors capture

01:12.520 --> 01:17.480
images in varying shades of black and white, which are then colourised and combined to

01:17.480 --> 01:23.480
create a vibrant final picture. However, some of the colours are exaggerated so that we can

01:23.480 --> 01:28.880
see parts of the universe that are normally invisible to our eyes, highlighting interesting

01:28.880 --> 01:37.520
features so that scientists can better understand the distant objects they are viewing.

01:37.520 --> 01:43.360
It has made over one million incredible observations since its launch, which include the birth

01:43.360 --> 01:49.520
and death of stars. Swirling galaxies billions of light-years away and closer to home, it

01:49.520 --> 01:54.720
has viewed the planets of our solar system in such high detail that only spacecraft that

01:54.720 --> 02:01.240
actually visit our neighbouring worlds can surpass its images. By peering out into deep

02:01.240 --> 02:07.040
space, scientists have learnt a lot about the universe, even estimating its age, which

02:07.040 --> 02:14.840
it turns out is around 14 billion years old. The Hubble Space Telescope is one of the most

02:14.880 --> 02:21.880
ambitious and influential astronomical projects in human history. It has taken arguably the

02:21.880 --> 02:28.880
greatest images of space ever seen, and captured the public imagination like no other. Will

02:28.880 --> 02:34.640
it soon become overshadowed by the James Webb Space Telescope? Perhaps in time it will,

02:34.640 --> 02:40.860
but for now Hubble remains one of the best and most successful tools we have for exploring

02:40.940 --> 02:47.940
the farthest reaches of the universe. So sit back, relax and allow me to take you on a

02:47.940 --> 02:54.260
journey through the cosmos as we immerse ourselves in a selection of the greatest images ever

02:54.260 --> 02:57.260
captured by the Hubble Space Telescope.

03:10.860 --> 03:14.860
Hubblecast is produced by ESA, the European Southern Observatory.
