{"label": "Introduction to Jupiter", "image": "pictures/jupiter1.webp", "text": "Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, has captured the imagination of humans for centuries. It is easily visible to the naked eye from Earth and has been recognized across cultures with divine significance. In Roman mythology, it was named after Jupiter, the king of the gods, while the Greeks associated it with Zeus, the god of thunder and the ruler of Mount Olympus. In ancient Mesopotamia, it was revered as the god Marduk, and among the Germanic tribes, it was known as Donar or Thor, the god of thunder.\nThe planet was first observed in detail by Galileo Galilei in 1610, who made groundbreaking discoveries, including the four largest moons of Jupiter, known today as the Galilean moons. This was a turning point in astronomy, providing evidence that not all celestial bodies orbit the Earth, challenging the geocentric view of the universe.\nIn modern times, nine spacecraft have visited Jupiter to study the planet closely, helping scientists unravel its mysteries. These missions have focused on understanding Jupiter’s chemical composition, its interior structure, and its atmosphere, along with taking stunning images of the planet’s swirling clouds and immense storms. Some of these images are so strikingly colorful that they resemble abstract works of art, revealing the beauty and complexity of this giant world."}

{"label": "Jupiter data", "image": "pictures/jupiter2.webp", "text": "Jupiter is a gaseous giant, meaning it is composed mostly of gases like hydrogen and helium, and is the largest planet in our solar system. With a diameter of 143,000 kilometers, it is more than twice the size of all the other planets combined. In fact, more than a thousand Earths could fit inside Jupiter. If Earth were the size of a 5-cent coin, Jupiter would be as large as a balloon ball, emphasizing just how enormous it is.\nDespite its massive size, Jupiter has an incredibly fast rotation. A day on Jupiter lasts only 10 hours, making it the planet with the fastest rotation in the entire solar system. This rapid rotation contributes to its distinctive flattened shape at the poles and its powerful storm systems.\nEven though it orbits the Sun at a distance of about 800 million kilometers, Jupiter is one of the brightest objects in the night sky. It reflects a significant amount of sunlight, making it a prominent feature for observers on Earth, especially during certain times of the year."}

{"label": "Jupiter's structure", "image": "pictures/jupiter3.webp", "text": "With binoculars or a telescope, Jupiter appears magnificent, clearly visible as a disk. The four largest moons of Jupiter, known as the Galilean moons, are easily visible. These moons, discovered by Galileo in 1610, are unique and remarkable worlds of their own, deserving of their own exploration.\nWhile Jupiter does have rings, they are not as prominent or as well-known as Saturn's rings. Jupiter's rings are thin and composed mainly of dust particles rather than the icy rings of Saturn.\nWhen observing Jupiter, we do not see a solid surface; instead, we are looking at the upper layers of its clouds, which are a strange combination of both permanence and change. The atmosphere of Jupiter has bands with multiple stripes running parallel to its equator. The lighter stripes are known as zones, and the darker ones are called belts. These features are quite stable, but their shape and color can change over time.\nJupiter's atmosphere is mainly made up of hydrogen and helium, similar to the Sun's composition, but it also contains ammonia, water vapor, methane, and other harmful gases. The belts and zones are driven by convection currents in the atmosphere. As the warm air ascends, it cools and forms white clouds of ammonia. This air then flows outward and sinks, creating a dynamic, shifting weather pattern on the gas giant.\nThe sunlight also plays a role in changing the chemistry of the clouds, forming molecules that result in the yellow, red, and brown colors we see, which in turn influence the darker belts in the planet's atmosphere."}

{"label": "Jupiter's weather", "image": "pictures/jupiter4.webp", "text": "Turbulence in the regions between Jupiter's zones and belts can give rise to powerful storms and giant vortices that twist through the clouds. Dozens of these storms occur on the gas giant. One of the most famous of these is the Great Red Spot, a persistent storm that has been raging for centuries.\nThe stability of this giant vortex can be attributed to Jupiter's rapid rotation. When a vortex, or rotating region in a fluid, is embedded in a rotating medium, it can persist over long periods of time. Jupiter's swift rotation is what sustains the Great Red Spot, keeping it circulating. The red color of the spot is likely due to molecules similar to cyanide, which absorb blue light, allowing the redder light to pass through, creating the planet's distinctive feature.\nInterestingly, the Great Red Spot has been shrinking over time. It was significantly larger and longer in the past. Over the years, it has also changed color, shifting from a deep red to a salmon hue and then back to red. The exact cause of these changes is still unknown, but due to the immense duration of the storm, it is unlikely to dissipate any time soon.\nSo far, we have only discussed the uppermost layers of Jupiter's clouds, but beneath them, the complexity deepens. The planet’s atmosphere extends for hundreds of kilometers in depth. Instruments like those on the Juno spacecraft have uncovered that the winds in the upper clouds, which blow from east to west, aren't just a surface-level phenomenon. These winds actually penetrate thousands of kilometers into the planet.\nThe Great Red Spot itself extends to about 300 kilometers deep into the atmosphere, demonstrating the profound depth of the planet's weather systems. As we descend further into Jupiter's atmosphere, the pressure increases dramatically. However, Jupiter doesn't have a solid surface like Earth, and a spacecraft attempting to land on the planet would have nowhere to rest. The extreme pressures and temperatures inside Jupiter would crush, melt, and vaporize any spacecraft that ventured too close."}

{"label": "Jupiter's mantles", "image": "pictures/jupiter5.webp", "text": "As we go deeper into Jupiter, the gas becomes thicker and hotter, eventually transitioning into a liquid state several hundred kilometers below its clouds. This makes Jupiter the home to the largest ocean in the solar system. But this is just the beginning of the strange things that await below the clouds.\nInstead of a solid mantle like the terrestrial planets, Jupiter has a huge region of metallic hydrogen. Under normal conditions, hydrogen exists as a gas, and if it cools, it becomes a liquid. However, under the extreme pressures inside Jupiter, hydrogen undergoes a remarkable transformation. The atoms no longer keep their electrons to themselves; instead, they share them. This causes hydrogen to take on properties similar to a metal, making it able to conduct electricity.\nThis metallic hydrogen is also incredibly hot, with temperatures reaching 10,000 degrees Celsius, much hotter than the surface of the Sun. If we could see it, it would shine incredibly brightly, a hidden world within the planet.\nBefore the Juno spacecraft arrived to study Jupiter, scientists had a few theories about its core. Some thought it might be a solid core, while others speculated it could be a superheated, dense mixture of gases. There was even the possibility that Jupiter didn't have a core at all.\nThanks to Juno's instruments, scientists were able to peer into the depths of the gas giant and reveal its core for the first time. Juno's findings showed that Jupiter does indeed have a core, but it's not what they expected. Rather than being a compact, solid ball, the core is a diffuse sphere, stretching across almost half the diameter of the entire planet. This discovery has reshaped our understanding of Jupiter's inner workings."}

{"label": "Jupiter as a star", "image": "pictures/jupiter6.webp", "text": "Jupiter is an incredible planet, but the question arises: how close was it to becoming a star?\nThere has been a popular belief that Jupiter almost became a star during its formation, as it gathered enough mass for nuclear fusion to start in its center. However, this is a misconception.\nIn order for a star to form, hydrogen fusion occurs when the star's gravity compresses atoms in its core enough to cause them to merge. This fusion process begins when a star has about one-tenth of the mass of the Sun. The smallest stars that have been observed are around this mass.\nIn contrast, Jupiter’s mass is only one-thousandth of the Sun's mass, far too small for fusion to occur in its core. To actually become a star, Jupiter would need to gain about 80 times its current mass. So, while it may have come close, it was never on the brink of becoming a star.\nJupiter also has a curious property: it emits more heat than it receives from the Sun. On Earth and other rocky planets, we are in thermal balance with the Sun, meaning we emit almost the same amount of heat that we receive. However, Jupiter is different.\nAfter forming, Jupiter began to cool and radiate heat from its upper atmosphere. A significant portion of Jupiter is made up of gas, and when gas cools, it contracts. As the atmosphere cools and contracts, the pressure inside increases, leading to more heat production. This heat then escapes from Jupiter, radiating out as infrared light. As a result, Jupiter emits more heat than it receives from the Sun.\nThe zones and belts that we see in Jupiter’s atmosphere, along with the massive storms, are driven largely by this internal heat. On Earth, our climate is primarily driven by the Sun’s energy, but Jupiter’s energy comes from within the planet itself.\nThe large, diffuse core of Jupiter likely plays a crucial role in this unique behavior, affecting many aspects of how the planet functions."}

{"label": "Jupiter's magnetic field", "image": "pictures/jupiter7.webp", "text": "Jupiter’s magnetic field is another fascinating and unusual feature. For decades, scientists believed it was similar to Earth’s, with a large bar magnet-like field, a clear north pole and south pole. However, Juno’s measurements revealed that Jupiter’s magnetic field is actually far more complex.\nIn the northern hemisphere, the magnetic field isn’t centered around a specific point; instead, it is slanted and sprouts out like errant weeds along a high-altitude strip. In the southern hemisphere, the situation is even stranger, as the magnetic field is split—part of it is submerged around the south pole, while another part is concentrated near the equator.\nThis strange magnetic field is just one part of Jupiter's dynamic system. The planet’s size and gravity make it a prime target for interplanetary debris. Jupiter gets hit by more space debris than Earth, including meteors and comets. For instance, in 1994, Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 collided with Jupiter. The planet’s intense gravitational pull had already torn the comet into many pieces before they slammed into Jupiter’s atmosphere, each impact releasing energy equivalent to millions of nuclear weapons. The scars left by these impacts remained visible for months.\nIn fact, such impacts occur on a regular basis, often large enough to be spotted from Earth, roughly every year. Jupiter’s immense size and gravitational force make it an effective shield for the inner solar system, preventing many of these objects from reaching the smaller planets like Earth."}

{"label": "Outro", "image": "pictures/jupiter8.webp", "text": "Jupiter’s immense gravity, although often seen as a threat due to its frequent collisions with comets and other debris, might actually be our protector. Jupiter tends to throw comets that venture too close into interstellar space, effectively removing potential threats from the inner solar system. Over the eons, this gravitational defense has cleaned up many objects that could have been dangerous, possibly even preventing some from striking Earth.\nHowever, Jupiter also distorts the orbits of some comets, occasionally causing them to pass near Earth, making it difficult to determine if its influence is ultimately beneficial. But one thing is clear: Jupiter is undeniably one of the most majestic planets in the solar system.\nThe video wraps up by inviting viewers to share their thoughts about Jupiter and its fascinating characteristics.
