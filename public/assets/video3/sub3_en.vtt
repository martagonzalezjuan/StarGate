00:30.000 --> 00:53.960
Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system, and is one of the planets visible

00:53.960 --> 01:03.960
to the naked eye of the Earth. Jupiter bears the name of the king of the Roman gods. For the Greeks, he represented Zeus, the god of the throne.

01:03.960 --> 01:10.960
The Mesopotamians saw Jupiter as the god Marduk, and the Germanic tribes saw this planet as Donar or Thor.

01:10.960 --> 01:18.960
In 1610, Galileo made the first detailed observations of Jupiter, making great discoveries for astronomy.

01:18.960 --> 01:26.960
In more recent times, nine space ships have studied Jupiter closely, in search of clues about its origin and evolution.

01:26.960 --> 01:36.960
These ships have examined its chemical composition, its interior structure, its atmosphere, and have taken spectacular images that seem colorful works of abstract art.

01:37.960 --> 01:53.960
Jupiter is a gaseous giant, which means that it is gaseous and giant. It has a diameter of 143,000 km, and is more than twice the size of the other planets together.

01:53.960 --> 02:05.960
More than a thousand Earths could fit inside it. If the Earth were the size of a 5-cent coin, Jupiter would be as big as a balloon ball.

02:06.960 --> 02:18.960
Despite its volume, Jupiter rotates extremely fast. One day in Jupiter lasts only 10 hours. It is the planet with the fastest rotation of the solar system.

02:18.960 --> 02:30.960
Jupiter reflects a lot of sunlight, and although it orbits around the Sun at an average distance of about 800 million kilometers, it is one of the brightest objects in the night sky.

02:30.960 --> 02:40.960
With binoculars or a telescope, Jupiter looks magnificent. It can be easily seen as a disk, and its four largest moons are easily visible.

02:40.960 --> 02:48.960
Galileo discovered these moons, which are unique and incredible worlds, which deserve their own episode.

02:48.960 --> 02:59.960
This planet also has several rings, but unlike Saturn's famous rings, Jupiter's rings are very thin and are made of dust, not ice.

02:59.960 --> 03:09.960
When we look at Jupiter, we do not see its surface. We are seeing the upper part of its clouds, and they are a strange mixture of permanence and change.

03:09.960 --> 03:15.960
Jupiter's atmosphere has bands, with multiple stripes parallel to its equator.

03:15.960 --> 03:25.960
The lighter colored stripes are called zones, and the darker ones, belts. They are quite stable, although their shape and color change over time.

03:25.960 --> 03:35.960
Similar to the composition of the Sun, Jupiter's air is mainly hydrogen and helium, but it is also mixed with ammonia, water, methane and other poisonous gases.

03:35.960 --> 03:43.960
The belts and zones circulate around the planet in opposite directions. They are formed due to convection in Jupiter's atmosphere.

03:44.960 --> 03:51.960
The ascending air cools and forms the white clouds of ammonia. That air flows to both sides and sinks.

03:51.960 --> 03:59.960
The sunlight changes the chemistry of the clouds, forming molecules that give color to the air, which is seen in yellow, red and brown.

03:59.960 --> 04:02.960
This is what causes the darker belts.

04:04.960 --> 04:12.960
Turbulences in the regions between zones and belts can create storms, giant vortices that untie in the clouds.

04:12.960 --> 04:37.700
Dozens of them

04:37.960 --> 04:39.960
But why is it so stable?

04:39.960 --> 04:47.960
It turns out that a vortex, a region of local rotation in a fluid, can persist if the fluid in which it is embedded is rotating.

04:47.960 --> 04:52.960
Jupiter's rapid rotation is what keeps the great red spot circulating.

04:52.960 --> 05:00.960
And the redness is probably due to the molecules similar to cyanide, which absorb the blue light, letting the redder light pass.

05:01.960 --> 05:09.960
Strangely, the red spot seems to be shrinking. It was substantially larger and longer a few decades ago.

05:09.960 --> 05:16.960
It also changes color over time. It has gone from intense red to salmon and then red again.

05:16.960 --> 05:23.960
It is not yet known why it changes its shape, size and color, but given the time it takes to the great red spot, I don't think it will evaporate soon.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.960
Jupiter's clouds

05:26.960 --> 05:32.960
We have only talked about the upper part of Jupiter's clouds. There is a lot of complexity below.

05:32.960 --> 05:38.960
Its atmosphere is very thick and has several hundreds of kilometers of depth.

05:38.960 --> 05:46.960
A microwave instrument that allows the Juno spacecraft to probe below the clouds has discovered that the winds from east to west,

05:46.960 --> 05:51.960
which is known to cross the peaks of Jupiter's clouds, are not only a great altitude phenomenon.

05:51.960 --> 05:55.960
The winds actually penetrate thousands of kilometers down.

05:55.960 --> 06:01.960
The same happens with the great red spot of Jupiter, which extends down about 300 kilometers.

06:06.960 --> 06:11.960
Submerging in the atmosphere of Jupiter, the pressure increases more and more with the depth.

06:11.960 --> 06:17.960
But we would never reach the surface. The planet does not really have a suitable surface.

06:17.960 --> 06:23.960
A spaceship would not have a place to land on Jupiter and it would not be able to fly either.

06:23.960 --> 06:33.960
The pressures and extreme temperatures inside Jupiter would crush, melt and vaporize the spaceships that try to fly on the planet.

06:33.960 --> 06:43.960
Below, the gas becomes thicker and hotter and eventually becomes a liquid in a range of several hundreds of kilometers below the clouds.

06:43.960 --> 06:47.960
This gives Jupiter the largest ocean in the solar system.

06:47.960 --> 06:52.960
Below, this is where things get really strange.

06:55.960 --> 07:02.960
Instead of a mantle like the terrestrial planets, Jupiter has a huge region formed by metallic hydrogen.

07:02.960 --> 07:06.960
Hydrogen is a gas. If it cools a lot, a liquid.

07:06.960 --> 07:13.960
But under the ridiculous pressures generated inside Jupiter, hydrogen suffers a strange transformation.

07:13.960 --> 07:17.960
Individual atoms do not have their electrons, but they share them.

07:17.960 --> 07:23.960
This means that hydrogen can conduct electricity and has other properties similar to a metal.

07:23.960 --> 07:31.960
This substance is also hot, about 10,000 degrees Celsius, hotter than the surface of the sun.

07:31.960 --> 07:35.960
If we could see it, it would be tremendously bright.

07:35.960 --> 07:45.960
Before the space shuttle Juno studied Jupiter, scientists theorized that it could have a central core of solid material, or it could be a thick, super hot and dense soup.

07:45.960 --> 07:48.960
Also, that it possibly did not have a core in the first place.

07:48.960 --> 07:57.960
Then, Juno's instruments began to trace the heart of the gaseous giant, revealing the mysterious core for the first time.

07:57.960 --> 08:05.960
Juno allowed scientists to deduce how mass is distributed in the depths of the planet, making maps that show that Jupiter does have a core.

08:05.960 --> 08:09.960
But not one that looks like anything they expected.

08:09.960 --> 08:17.960
Instead of being a compact ball, the core is really a diffuse sphere that extends by almost half the diameter of Jupiter.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.960
So, Jupiter is a great planet.

08:20.960 --> 08:24.960
But how close was it to becoming a star?

08:28.960 --> 08:38.960
There has been a popular belief that as the planet formed, it almost became massive enough so that nuclear fusion could begin in its center, turning it into a star.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.960
But this is wrong.

08:40.960 --> 08:50.960
When a star is formed, hydrogen fusion begins when the star accumulates so much mass that its gravity can compress the atoms in its nucleus, enough to make it merge.

08:50.960 --> 08:55.960
This happens when a star has approximately one-dose of the mass of the sun.

08:55.960 --> 08:59.960
In fact, the smallest stars that have been seen have that mass.

08:59.960 --> 09:04.960
Jupiter's mass is approximately one-thousandth of the mass of the sun.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.960
It is too small to experience a fusion in its nucleus.

09:07.960 --> 09:12.960
For Jupiter to be a star, it would be necessary to add another 80 Jupiter.

09:12.960 --> 09:15.960
Jupiter has another curious property.

09:15.960 --> 09:18.960
It emits more heat than it receives from the sun.

09:18.960 --> 09:23.960
Earth and other terrestrial or rocky planets are in thermal balance with the sun.

09:23.960 --> 09:27.960
We emit practically the same amount of heat that we receive.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.960
But Jupiter is different.

09:29.960 --> 09:34.960
After it formed, it began to cool down and radiate heat from its upper atmosphere.

09:34.960 --> 09:36.960
A large fraction of the planet is gas.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.960
When a gas cools down, it contracts.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.960
Then, the atmosphere cools down and contracts.

09:41.960 --> 09:45.960
This increases the pressure inside the planet, so it heats up.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.960
That heat comes out of Jupiter and radiates like infrared light.

09:49.960 --> 09:55.960
In the end, the amount of heat that Jupiter emits is more than what it receives from the sun.

09:55.960 --> 09:59.960
The zones and belts, the rays that we see in the atmosphere of Jupiter,

09:59.960 --> 10:05.960
and all the storms that arise are largely driven by the internal heat of Jupiter.

10:05.960 --> 10:08.960
On Earth, our climate is fed by the heat of the sun,

10:08.960 --> 10:12.960
but Jupiter gets its energy from the planet itself.

10:13.960 --> 10:20.960
The huge diffuse nucleus of Jupiter undoubtedly has implications for other aspects of the planet's behavior.

10:20.960 --> 10:24.960
One of them is its unusual twisted magnetic field.

10:24.960 --> 10:29.960
For decades, it was believed that the Jovian magnetic field was similar to that of Earth.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.960
In other words, it looked like the field of a really large bar magnet,

10:32.960 --> 10:38.960
with a well-defined magnetic north pole at one end and a well-defined south pole at the other.

10:38.960 --> 10:44.960
A quick look at previous spaceships seemed to confirm that, but they were wrong.

10:44.960 --> 10:49.960
Juno's measurements show that the magnetic field in the northern hemisphere of Jupiter

10:49.960 --> 10:51.960
looks completely different from that of the south.

10:51.960 --> 10:54.960
In the north, the extreme is slanted.

10:54.960 --> 10:59.960
Instead of emerging around a central point, the magnetic field sprouts like bad herbs,

10:59.960 --> 11:02.960
along a long strip of high altitude.

11:02.960 --> 11:04.960
In the south, the extreme is divided.

11:04.960 --> 11:08.960
Part of the field is submerged again in the planet around the south pole,

11:08.960 --> 11:12.960
while another part is concentrated in a point just south of the equator.

11:12.960 --> 11:16.960
The Earth is hit by interplanetary debris all the time.

11:16.960 --> 11:21.960
If you go out at night for a while, you will surely see some meteors.

11:21.960 --> 11:27.960
Jupiter, being larger and more serious, receives many more blows, many more.

11:27.960 --> 11:33.960
In 1994, the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 hit Jupiter.

11:33.960 --> 11:39.960
The fierce gravitational waves of Jupiter had torn the comet into dozens of pieces,

11:39.960 --> 11:43.960
and each one of them crashed against the planet, one after the other,

11:43.960 --> 11:46.960
with the force of millions of nuclear weapons.

11:46.960 --> 11:50.960
The scars left in the upper atmosphere lasted for months.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.960
Many have been seen in the atmosphere of Jupiter,

11:53.960 --> 11:59.960
and can have an impact large enough to be seen from Earth, approximately every year.

11:59.960 --> 12:04.960
And while that sounds scary, it could actually be our savior.

12:04.960 --> 12:10.960
There is the idea that Jupiter's gravity tends to take comets that fall into the interior solar system

12:10.960 --> 12:12.960
and throw them into interstellar space.

12:12.960 --> 12:18.960
Throughout the eons, this has cleaned up many objects that would otherwise be dangerous,

12:18.960 --> 12:22.960
and could eventually have hit Earth.

12:23.960 --> 12:29.960
On the other hand, Jupiter tends to deform the orbits of some comets so that they pass through Earth.

12:29.960 --> 12:33.960
It is difficult to say whether Jupiter's influence is a net benefit or not,

12:33.960 --> 12:40.960
but in any case, it is clearly one of the most majestic planets in the solar system.

12:52.960 --> 12:57.960
What do you think about Jupiter?

13:16.960 --> 13:19.960
Tell me, have you learned anything today about Jupiter?

13:19.960 --> 13:22.960
I would love to see what you think in the comments.
